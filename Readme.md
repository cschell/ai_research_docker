# AI Research Docker Images

During my work as a research assistant I have to reproduce and run various projects from different papers. Since some of the projects are older and not always coded and documented according to best practices, getting these code bases up and running can be very tedious and time consuming. Fortunately, Docker offers a good way to create isolated and reproducible environments that bring these projects back to life.

This repository is where I publish the Dockerfiles that help me run the projects on my Ubuntu machine. This means that there are certainly some issues for certain applications and certain environments, so if you find ways to improve the Dockerfiles, I'm very happy about feedback :-)
